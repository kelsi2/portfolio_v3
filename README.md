# Personal Portfolio - V3

This is the current version of my personal portfolio. It has gone through many iterations to get where it is, this version was built with simple HTML, CSS, and JS.

I learned a lot building this project, including using image source-sets and better quality formats to improve performance, improved accessibility, best practices for design, and creating my own logo and brand. I'm very pleased with the outcome!
